:::warning
When writing this document, the `GoneBot` version was `v1.1.4`
:::

It is because of the diversity of the platform, the behavior of the adapter may be very different, so `GoneBot` can not give a completely strict and controllable standard for the adapter, only give a general specification, the specific implementation is still up to the developer to decide. If you encounter an adapter that is very unstable but must be used, you may need to try to solve it by yourself.

Please continue to the next section to learn about the development requirements for the adapter.
